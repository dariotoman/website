    title: "Welcome!"
    excerpt: >
      I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Toronto. In my research, I employ
      empirical microeconomics to answer questions in political economy and health. My job market
      paper studies the consequences of <em>partisan local elections</em> for electoral competition,
      candidate selection, and governance. A second strand of my research examines how electoral
      and judicial institutions shape gendered access to healthcare and justice.
      <br><br><em>I will be on the job market in 2025â€“2026.</em>
