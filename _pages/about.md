I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Toronto working at the intersection of political economy and development economics. My job market paper studies the consequences of partisan local elections for electoral competition, candidate selection, and governance. A second strand of my research examines how electoral and judicial institutions shape gendered access to healthcare and justice.

I will be on the job market in 2025â€“2026.
