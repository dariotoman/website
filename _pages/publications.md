### The Effects of Conditional Cash Transfers on Conflict Dynamics in Colombia _(2019_)
With civil war being a common curse of underdeveloped economies, understanding the effects of aid 
on armed conflict is of paramount importance in forming development aid policy. In this paper, I 
consider the effects of the Familias en Acci\'on conditional cash transfer program on conflict dynamics 
in early 2000s Colombia. By exploiting spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the implementation of the 
CCT, I am able to recover a differences-in-differences estimate of treatment effect. My results indicate
 that the intervention caused a short-term increase in conflict intensity in municipalities that receive
  the cash transfer, characterized by more frequent clashes between rebel groups and government forces. 
  In distinguishing between guerilla-side and government-side mechanisms, I find suggestive evidence that
   guerilla-side mechanisms are salient, consistent with increased rent-seeking activities, but no conclusive support for the 
   "Hearts and Minds'' hypothesis.
