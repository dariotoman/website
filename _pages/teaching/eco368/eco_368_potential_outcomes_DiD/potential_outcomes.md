### Probability Recap

- To understand this tutorial, it is crucial that you understand conditional expectations:
$$ \mathbb{E}[X|Y=y] $$

- Example: 
$$ \mathbb{E}[\text{Height} | \text{Occupation = Firefighter}]$$

### Numerical Example

## Potential Outcome Models

### Motivation: The health effects of hospital visits

- Suppose you are interested in studying the health effects of hospital visits, and have access to data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)
- This data has 2 questions that may be helpful in your analysis:
    - "During the last 12 months, was the respondent a patient in a hospital overnight?"
    - "Would you say your health in general is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?"
- This data allows you to identify individuals who visit hospitals, and their health.

### Do hospitals make people healthier?

- A Na√Øve comparison of averages will lead you to conclude that hospitals make people sicker! 
- Why is this the case?
    - Clearly, the people who go to hospitals are very different from people who don't...
        - Typically people who choose to go to a hospital are already sick.
- Simply comparing the _treated_ population to the _untreated_ or _control_ population will introduce **Selection Bias**

--

## Potential Outcome Models

- Potential Outcome primarily aim to address this issue of selection bias when estimating the _causal effect_ of a treatment. 
- In this context **treatment** refers to some kind of intervention. Could be:
    - A hospital visit
    - Implementation of an aid program
    - Exposure to conflict
