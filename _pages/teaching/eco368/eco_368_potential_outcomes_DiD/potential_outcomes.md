### Probability Recap

- To understand this tutorial, it is crucial that you understand conditional expectations:
$$ \mathbb{E}[X|Y=y] $$

- Example: 
$$ \mathbb{E}[\text{Height} | \text{Occupation = Firefighter}]$$

### Motivation: The health effects of hospital visits

- Suppose you are interested in studying the health effects of hospital visits, and have access to data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)
- This data has 2 questions that may be helpful in your analysis:
    - "During the last 12 months, was the respondent a patient in a hospital overnight?"
    - "Would you say your health in general is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?"
- This data allows you to identify individuals who visit hospitals, and their health.

| Group       | Sample Size | Mean Health Status | Std. Error |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|------------|
| Hospital    | 7,774       | 3.21               | 0.014      |
| No Hospital | 90,049      | 3.93               | 0.003      |
