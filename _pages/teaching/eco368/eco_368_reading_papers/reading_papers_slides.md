- A layman can identify that the images you've just seen are important. 
- An **art historian** can tell you much more:
    - The artist
    - The movement/style
    - The inspiration/influences of the artist
    - The techniques used
    - The symbolism
    - Who was inspired by it
    - Why we should care!
