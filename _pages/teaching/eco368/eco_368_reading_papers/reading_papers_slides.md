- A layman can identify that the image you've just seen is important. 
- An **art historian** can tell you much more: 
    * The artist  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment -->
    * The movement/style  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment -->
    * The inspiration/influences of the artist <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment -->
    * The techniques used <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment -->
    * The symbolism <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment -->
    * Who was inspired by it <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment -->
    * Why we should care! <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment -->

- A fundamental part of your your training as an economist is to learn how speak about economics research in the way that art historians speak about art.
- Part of this training involve understanding how to analyze the papers you read.

### The Big Questions

- Who wrote the paper? When? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment -->
- What question are they trying to answer? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment -->
- Why are they asking the question? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment -->
- How are they trying to answer it? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment -->
- What are their results? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment -->
- Do you believe the results? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment -->
- Implications? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment -->

----

### Who wrote the paper?

--

- What is the author's research agenda?
- Are there other authors that they are debating in the literature? 
- We typically refer to papers by _Author Last Name, YYYY_ in economics. 
    - For example: Sambanis, 2004 
    - not: ~~What Is Civil War? Conceptual and Empirical Complexities of an Operational Definition~~ 

----

### What question are they trying to answer?

--

- This _should_ be fairly clear from the abstract 
- Explicitly identifying the question will help you focus your analysis as you read the paper 


----

### Why are they asking the question?

--

- This is a slighly more nuanced question. We are interested in:
    - Motivation
    - State of the literature

----

### How are they trying to answer it?

--

- This will vary based on the type of paper you are reading:
    - Theory
    - Literature review / meta-analysis
    - Empirical Study
        - For Empirical papers, economists talk about the _Empirical Strategy_.

    
--


**For Empirical Studies:**
- What is the setting and context?
- What kind of model are they using?
    - What assumptions does this model require?    

----

### What are their results?

--

- What do they report?
- Anything surprising?
- Does this support predictions from economic theory?

----

### Do you believe the results?

--

Economists tend to talk about 2 "kinds" of _validity_?

**Internal Validity:**
- Are the assumptions of the model being used met?
    - The answer is usually no. How do these failed assumptions affect interpretation of results?

**External Validity**
- Is it reasonable to believe that the results will hold in other settings?

----

### Implications?

--

- What policy implications do the results have?
- Is there a mechanism/topic that we need more research on?
