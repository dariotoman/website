## Causes of Civil War  

----

### "Greed and Grievances"
**Greed**
- Armed conflict is motivated by a "cost-benefit analysis" that insurgents make, evaluating their welfare under rebellion and peace.

**Grievance**
- Armed conflict is a result of rebellion over issues related to identity (ethnicity, race, class), not economics.

--

- The debate over "Greed and Grievances" was largely sparked by a report written by Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler in 2000
- In this report, the authors made a strong case for the "Greed" case
    - They find that civil war is correlated with factors related to greed, rather than grievances
- This model and its conclusions drew lots of criticism
