## Causes of Civil War  

----

### "Greed and Grievances"
**Greed**
- Armed conflict is motivated by a "cost-benefit analysis" that insurgents make, evaluating their welfare under rebellion and peace.

**Grievance**
- Armed conflict is a result of rebellion over issues related to identity (ethnicity, race, class), not economics.

--

- The debate over "Greed and Grievances" was largely sparked by a report written by Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler in 2000
- In this report, the authors made a strong case for the "Greed" case
    - They find that civil war is correlated with factors related to greed, rather than grievances
- This model and its conclusions drew lots of criticism

----

## Fearon and Laitin (2003)

--

- Fearon and Laitin are concerned with prevalence of civil war since 1990
    - They argue that these insurgencies occur where they are feasible
    - They view insurgency as a "technology" - what do they mean by this?
- Main Hypothesis: Weak governments provide good settings for insurgency

Main Conclusions


----

## Collier, Hoeffler, and Rohner(2009)

--

- In this paper, Collier, Hoeffler, and Rohner expand on their original work
    - Include more recent data
    - Address some of the concerns raised by others (including some of Fearon and Laitin's concerns)
    - Maintain that the "Greed" argument holds, with some "weak" evidence for the feasibility hypothesis

--

**Some Select Results**
- Civil war tends to occur in places with low GDP.
    - How do they interpret this?
- The effect of primary commodity exports has an "inverted U shape"
    - How do they conclude this?
    - Interpretation?

### Quick Metrics Recap: 2SLS

- Goal: solving endogeneity problem

**Estimation:**
- Step 1: Regress $ x = \gamma z + u $
- Step 2: Regress $ y = \beta \hat{x} +\varepsilon $

**Assumptions:**
- Instrument is relevant
- Instrument is exogenous
- _Exclusion Restriction Condition_

### Discussion:
## Why do Fearon+Laitin and Collier+Hoeffler+Rohner have "different" findings?

----

## Ross (2006)

--

- Ross (2006) focus on "resource" curses as the reason for civil conflict
- Fearon and Laitin (2003) and Collier (2004, 2009) already address resources
    - What is the issue?

>This “resource exports to GDP” measure was originally developed by
>Sachs & Warner (1995) and later adopted by Collier & Hoeffler (1998) and many
>others—including, regrettably, me (Ross 2001a).
