This page consists of a series of (rather unorganised) resources that I have found useful over the years.
It is primarily for me to refer back to, but other may also find some of them useful.

Programing
=========

## STATA
* Some of my favourite STATA commands for applied micro are:
    * **_esttsto/eststo/esttab_**: Very useful commands for creating publication tables that include multiple models, scalars, table notes, etc. Very easily integrates with LaTeX and includes _booktabs_ support. (I find this more usable that _outreg_)
    * **_reghdfe_**: Allows for multidimensional fixed effects models as well as simple two-way standard error clustering
    * **_spmap_**: Create nice maps!
    * **_did_multipleGT_**: A very usefull (new) tool for differences in differences estimation when there are multiple treatment groups, especially when treatment timing varies.
